## Hiya! I'm Jeremie *(lp1)*
# Friendly neighbourhood hacker, passionate about music, photography and tech-related stuff.<br/> I'm fluent in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript.

I am currently working as a freelance **security consultant** and **instructor**.
&nbsp;
I founded **<a href="https://fenrir.pro">fenrir.pro</a>** in late 2018, whose purpose is to deliver infosec services to startups and small companies for a affordable price.

I love to travel and take pictures of everything I come across, I'm currently living in Paris but I always spend at least part of the year around the world.
