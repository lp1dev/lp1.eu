## Hiya! I'm Jeremie
# Ethical hacker / developer passionate about music, cinema, photography and among other topics InfoSec.
# I'm fluent in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and like to work on Kotlin, C# and Java projects too!

I am currently working as a freelance **ethical hacker** and **web and mobile developer/instructor**, mostly with French clients, but feel free to contact me if you're living abroad!

I love to travel and take pictures of everything I come across, I'm currently living in Paris, but it's prone to change.
